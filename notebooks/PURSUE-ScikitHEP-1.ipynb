    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scikit-HEP is a community-driven project designed to provide a coherent collection of Python libraries for HEP. It is aimed at standardizing data analysis in HEP.\n",
    "* It integrates with other tools such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "* Among its major packages we have\n",
    "  * Uproot: For reading and writing ROOT files without requiring ROOT.\n",
    "  * Awkward Arrays: For the handling of jagged data structures\n",
    "  * Hist: For creating and manipulating histograms\n",
    "  * Vector: For manipulating and oprating on vectors of different kinds in a high-performance manner\n",
    "  * Boost-Histogram: For fast, multi-dimensional histogramming\n",
    "  * Particle: For handling particle physics data, including properties and PDG codes\n",
    "* In this tutorial, you will be introduced to the main components of the Scikit-HEP project. We will start with Uproot and build from there.\n",
    "* For more information on the Scikit-HEP project and the tools it offers, please visit the official website [Scikit-HEP Project Website](https://scikit-hep.org/)\n",

    "## ROOT?\n",
    "\n",
    "* ROOT files are a binary format designed for storage and analysis of large amounts of HEP data.\n",
    "* It stores data in a hierarchical structure. It contains a variety of data types such as TTrees and histograms.\n",
    "* In TTrees, each entry represents an event and each branch represents various pieces of data associated with said event.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"./assets/roottree.png\" alt=\"roottree\" style=\"width: 400px\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays\n",
    "* When running numerical computations involving a collection of numbers, the usual object of choice is the NumPy array. With these we can perform fast computations.\n",
    "* Numpy allows us to do operations between arrays instead of element by element. This type of array-wise operations are called vectorized operations and they are fundamental to a programming paradigm known as array-oriented programming which is commonly used in HEP. This is in constrast to the typical approach of iterating over a whole collection of objects, which can be rather slow procedure."
