    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uproot is a Scikit-HEP package which offers tools to read and write `.root` files without the use of ROOT.\n",
    "- In this session, we will be learning about this useful package by going through the [HSF Uproot Tutorial](https://masonproffitt.github.io/uproot-tutorial/).\n",
    "- This notebook is meant to summarize the material found in the afformentioned tutorial, while expanding on some points not emphasized there, and can be used as a quick reference or to follow along during the session. \n",
    "- For a more complete description of Uproot and other Scikit-HEP packages, please visit the [Scikit-HEP Project Website](https://scikit-hep.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## ROOT?\n",
    "- Root is a specialized data format designed to store large amounts of data in a structured way.\n",
    "- They can contain a variety of data types such as histograms.\n",
    "- One of the key features of a root file is the TTree structure in which each entry represents an event and each branch various pieces of data associated with said event.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays\n",
    "- When running numerical computations involving a collection of numbers, the usual object of choise is the numpy array. With these we can perform fast computations (Numpy is a compiled library)."
